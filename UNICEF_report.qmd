## [Introduction]{style="font-family: serif"}

In every corner of our world, the journey of childhood unfolds with both promise and pitfalls. Where the glow of hope is often shadowed by the realities of stunted growth and the silent spread of HIV.

This dashboard invites you to explore the global landscape of child development, weaving together vivid data on child stunting and HIV awareness to reveal the stark contrasts and hidden connections shaping young lives.

## [HIV Knowledge Among Youth by Country]{style="font-family: serif"}

This comparison highlights the percentage of young people (aged 15â€“24) who possess comprehensive, correct knowledge of HIV across countries. By displaying both the leaders and laggards, we can better understand the global disparities in HIV education. This helps policymakers identify both success stories to emulate and areas where urgent action is needed.

:::

This tabbed comparison reveals stark disparities in HIV knowledge among youth globally. The top-performing countries (primarily in Eastern and Southern Africa) have achieved knowledge rates above 50%, while the lowest-performing countries show rates below 5%. 

This significant gap (over 55 percentage points between highest and lowest) highlights implementation disparities in HIV education programs worldwide. Countries at the bottom of the ranking could benefit from adapting successful education strategies from top-performing nations.

## [Top 4 Countries with HIV Knowledge Trends Over Time]{style="font-family: serif"}

This line chart tracks the evolution of HIV knowledge among males and females in 4 countries over time.

These visualizations reveal several important patterns in global HIV knowledge:

1. **Persistent Gender Gap**: The boxplots show that, on average, males tend to have higher levels of HIV knowledge than females across countries. The median knowledge level for males is noticeably higher than for females.

2. **Wide Variation Between Countries**: There is substantial variation in HIV knowledge levels across countries, with some countries showing knowledge rates above 50% while others fall below 5%.

3. **Country-Level Gender Disparities**: The comparison plot clearly shows that in most countries (points falling above the dashed line), males have higher knowledge levels than females. However, there are some exceptions where female knowledge exceeds male knowledge.

4. **Positive Correlation**: There is a strong positive correlation between male and female knowledge levels within countries. Countries that do well in educating one gender about HIV tend to also do well with the other gender.

5. **Regional Patterns**: Some of the highest-performing countries (labeled in the upper right) are clustered in Sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV prevalence is higher and education efforts have been more intensive.

These findings highlight the need for targeted educational interventions that address gender-specific barriers to HIV knowledge, with particular attention to countries and regions where overall knowledge levels remain low.

## [Child Stunting Burden by Country]{style="font-family: serif"}

This map displays the percentage of children under 5 affected by stunting (low height-for-age) in Africa and Asia, the two continents with the highest burden of child malnutrition.

:::

These maps illustrate the geographic distribution of child stunting across Africa and Asia, revealing distinct regional patterns:

1. **Concentration in Sub-Saharan Africa**: Countries in the Sahel region and Central Africa show some of the highest stunting rates, with over 30% of children affected in many nations.

2. **South Asian hotspot**: Countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal form a significant hotspot of child stunting, with India displaying particularly concerning rates.

3. **Variation within regions**: Both continents show significant variation, with some countries making substantial progress while neighboring nations continue to struggle.

The burden of stunting in these two continents is particularly concerning as they collectively account for over 80% of all stunted children worldwide. Targeted interventions in the darkest green areas represent opportunities for significant improvements in global child nutrition outcomes.

## [Progress in Reducing Child Stunting]{style="font-family: serif"}

This area chart tracks Bangladesh's progress in reducing child stunting over time. The visualization demonstrates the country's commitment to improving child nutrition and highlights the effectiveness of targeted interventions implemented over the years. The downward trend represents real improvements in the lives of children and showcases a public health success story that other countries might learn from.

This area chart illustrates Bangladesh's remarkable journey in reducing the prevalence of child stunting over time. The dark green area represents the percentage of children under 5 who are stunted (height-for-age below -2 standard deviations from the median).

The downward slope of the chart tells a positive story of nutrition improvement in Bangladesh, which has been achieved through a combination of:

1. **Targeted nutrition interventions** - Including micronutrient supplementation, promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, and complementary feeding practices

2. **Broader development progress** - Economic growth, improved food security, and enhanced maternal education

3. **Health system strengthening** - Better access to healthcare services, improved water and sanitation facilities, and increased immunization coverage

Bangladesh's progress serves as an inspiring example for other countries facing similar challenges. The consistent decline demonstrates that with sustained commitment and evidence-based approaches, significant improvements in child nutrition outcomes are achievable even in resource-constrained settings.

## [Conclusion]{style="font-family: serif"}

The analysis **reveals persistent and significant challenges** in both child stunting and HIV awareness among youth worldwide. **Stunting remains highly concentrated in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa**, with countries such as India, Bangladesh, and several Central African nations bearing the greatest burden. 

Despite some notable progress, represents by Bangladesh's steady reduction in stunting rates, **millions of children continue to face the lifelong consequences of undernutrition**. At the same time, global HIV knowledge among youth displays stark disparities, with leading countries in Eastern and Southern Africa achieving much higher awareness rates than those at the bottom of the scale.

Gender gaps further compound these issues, as **males generally possess higher HIV knowledge than females** in most countries.

These findings emphasised the urgent need for targeted, region-specific interventions that address both the immediate and systemic factors driving these public health challenges.

## [Solutions]{style="font-family: serif"}

1. Prioritize **targeted investments** in countries and regions with the highest rates of child stunting and lowest HIV knowledge, particularly in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
2. Develop and **implement gender-sensitive education campaigns** to close the HIV knowledge gap between males and females, ensuring equitable access to information for all youth.
3. **Integrate nutrition initiatives** with broader development strategies, including improving maternal education, healthcare access, water and sanitation, and food security.
4.Establish **robust data monitoring systems to track progress**, identify emerging gaps, and enable adaptive, evidence-based policymaking.
5. Foster **multisectoral collaboration** among governments, NGOs, and international organizations to address both immediate needs and the underlying social determinants of health.
6. Promote the **exchange of best practices** by learning from successful countries, adapting proven interventions to local contexts, and scaling up effective solutions.

By acting on these recommendations, we can accelerate progress and help more children grow up healthy and strong.
